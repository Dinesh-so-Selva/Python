# 🧠 Employee Engagement Automation using Python

## 📘 Project Description
This project focuses on **automating employee engagement** through a collection of **interactive Python-based games**.  
The goal is to enhance workplace morale and promote relaxation during work breaks by providing simple, fun, and stress-relieving activities.

Using **Python**, this project combines automation and gamification to support a healthy and engaging work culture.  
Each module or game in the notebooks acts as a digital activity to refresh employees’ minds and improve engagement creatively.

The project includes two main notebooks:
1. **Python_Project_-_1.ipynb** – Initial set of mini-games and logic-based activities for employees.  
2. **Python_project - 2.ipynb** – Extended version with additional games, automation features, and user interaction.
